# Abner Estrada


Senior Software Engineer | Passionate about Python, C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, ReactJs, and C | Experienced IAM Engineer with expertise in Azure AD, Active Directory, OAuth, OpenID Connect, SAML, LDAP, and IdM and designing performant systems.

About:
I believe in the philosophy that "there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving." As a professional developer with over 13 years of experience, I have used a broad range of technologies and specialize in creating applications using PHP, Python, Node, C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, ReactJs, and C. In addition, I have extensive experience as an IAM Engineer, responsible for the development and implementation of Identity Management (IdM), also known as Identity and Access Management (IAM). I have a particular expertise in Azure AD, Active Directory.

I am also a formally trained computer repair technician, so hardware is not a problem, and I can handle full-stack projects from napkin-scribbling to finished product. My enthusiasm, easy-going personality, and willingness to help and teach make me a pleasure to work with. I enjoy getting others excited about programming and web development and am always open to learning from open-source projects and trying new things. In my spare time, I love to travel with my family, spend time at the beach (especially in the Caribbean), and explore new places. I also enjoy spending time with my son and helping him discover the joys of programming.Senior Software Engineer
