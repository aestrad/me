About me

LIFE PHILOSOPHY “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”

I've been a professional developer since 2008, using a broad range of technologies. My passion is creating applications using PHP, Python, Node, C#,JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, ReactJs and Ruby. I'm also a formally trained Computer repair technician, so hardware is not a problem and can handle full-stack projects from napkin-scribbling to finished product.

I'm very enthusiastic, easy to get along and work with and love to help, teach and get others excited about programming and web development.
