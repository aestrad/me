## About me

I've been a professional developer since 2008, using a broad range of technologies. My passion is creating applications using PHP, Python, Node, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Angular, ReactJs, PowerShell. I'm also a formally trained Computer repair technician, so hardware is not a problem and can handle full-stack projects from napkin-scribbling to finished product.

I'm very enthusiastic, easy to get along and work with and love to help, teach and get others excited about programming and web development. In my spare time, I love to travel with my family, spend time at the beach (love the Caribbean), explore, learn from Open Source projects, trying things out and enjoy time with my son.
